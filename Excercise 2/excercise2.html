            <p>How I Met Your Mother follows Ted Mosby as he recounts to his children in 2030 the long, winding story of how he met their mother.
                 Set mostly in New York, the series flashes back to Ted’s younger years, focusing on his friendships with Marshall, Lily, Barney, and Robin. Ted, a hopeless romantic, navigates love, career struggles, and personal growth while searching for "The One."
                  Along the way, the show explores the evolving relationships within the group, particularly Ted’s on-and-off romance with Robin and Barney’s playboy antics.
                   The series builds up to the long-awaited reveal of the mother, Tracy McConnell, and ultimately delivers a bittersweet twist on love, fate, and friendship.</p>
